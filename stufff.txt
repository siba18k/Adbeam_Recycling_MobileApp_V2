Implement the use of fluid animations to make the app feel alive and responsive by
making the gradients move around slowly like a liquid and having the progress bar also fill up like a liquid.
I also want it so that if the user swipes left or right it takes the to the next screen with a clean
and responsive animation. Feel free to implement highly responsive and efficient css and react js frameworks to accomplish
this.
